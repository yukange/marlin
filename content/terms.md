# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the **Marlin** website and application (the "Service") operated by us.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Marlin is a local-first note-taking tool that syncs data to GitHub. We provide the software interface, but the storage backend is provided by GitHub (a third-party service). You acknowledge that Marlin is not responsible for the availability or performance of GitHub.

## 3. Licenses and Payments

### A. Free Plan
The Free Plan allows limited usage (e.g., limited number of Spaces) and is provided "as is" without warranty.

### B. Pro License
*   **One-Time Payment:** The Pro License is a one-time purchase that grants you lifetime access to all Pro features in the Service. This includes all future updates and improvements to the Pro tier.
*   **Feature Updates:** We may add, modify, or remove features from the Pro tier at our discretion. We will strive to maintain or improve the overall value of the Pro experience.
*   **Refunds:** Refunds are processed by Creem according to their refund policy. If a refund is issued, your Pro License key will be deactivated immediately.
*   **Taxes:** You are responsible for any applicable taxes, which are handled automatically by Creem at checkout.

## 4. User Responsibilities

*   **GitHub Account:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your GitHub account.
*   **Content:** You retain full ownership of all notes and content you create. You are solely responsible for the legality and appropriateness of your content.
*   **Prohibited Use:** You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by you), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Marlin.

## 6. Service Availability and Termination

### A. Service Availability
We strive to provide continuous access to the Service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. We may suspend or terminate the Service temporarily for maintenance, updates, or unforeseen circumstances.

### B. Termination by You
You may stop using the Service at any time by revoking Marlin's access in your GitHub settings.

### C. Termination by Us
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties, or for any other reason at our sole discretion.

### D. Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. Your notes remain in your GitHub repository and are unaffected by termination of access to Marlin.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Marlin makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the operation of the Service or the information, content, or materials included therein.

**We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.** While we strive for data safety, you acknowledge that no software is bug-free, and you should maintain your own backups (which GitHub provides automatically).

## 8. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Marlin be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.

## 9. Dispute Resolution

### A. Informal Resolution
Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at support@marlinnotes.com. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally within 30 days.

### B. Binding Arbitration
If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the arbitration body in the applicable jurisdiction, rather than in court.

### C. Exceptions
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service, or intellectual property infringement, without first engaging in arbitration.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the People's Republic of China, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the People's Republic of China.

## 11. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
