# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** December 1, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the **Marlin** website and application (the "Service") operated by us.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Marlin is a local-first note-taking tool that syncs data to GitHub. We provide the software interface, but the storage backend is provided by GitHub (a third-party service). You acknowledge that Marlin is not responsible for the availability or performance of GitHub.

## 3. Licenses and Payments

### A. Free Plan
The Free Plan allows limited usage (e.g., limited number of Spaces) and is provided "as is" without warranty.

### B. Pro License (Lifetime Deal)
*   **One-Time Payment:** The Pro License is a one-time purchase that grants you access to premium features for the lifetime of the Service's specific version (v6.x).
*   **Refunds:** Refunds are processed by Lemon Squeezy according to their refund policy. If a refund is issued, your Pro License key will be deactivated immediately.
*   **Taxes:** You are responsible for any applicable taxes, which are handled automatically by Lemon Squeezy at checkout.

## 4. User Responsibilities

*   **GitHub Account:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your GitHub account.
*   **Content:** You retain full ownership of all notes and content you create. You are solely responsible for the legality and appropriateness of your content.
*   **Prohibited Use:** You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by you), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Marlin.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Marlin makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the operation of the Service or the information, content, or materials included therein.

**We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.** While we strive for data safety, you acknowledge that no software is bug-free, and you should maintain your own backups (which GitHub provides automatically).

## 7. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Marlin be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.

## 8. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
